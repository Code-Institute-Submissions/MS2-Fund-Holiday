# Polygon FA
Polygon FA is a fictional Fund Accounting group within a large Fund Accounting department of an international administrator.
Fund Accounting is the process of calculating a NAV (Net Asset Value) per share for an Investment Fund and publishing that price in the financial markets.
The aim of this site is to streamline the processes around fund holidays which cause significant issues and take signicant unnecessary time in my experience.
This site will reduce the time spent validating holidays throughout the year from hours to minutes when holidays occur. 
Please see user stories below for specific issues.
